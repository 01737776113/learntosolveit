Application for PhD in Computer Science.

I would like to pursue a Ph.D Program in Computer Science at __________ ,
specializing in ________ and the study of related fields such as _________,
________, __________ and distributed systems.  I have a keen interest in
developing algorithms for modeling and solving real world problems.

As a PhD student, I would like to embark on a career devoted to the development
of computer science which will involve teaching and research on the development
of better software. My Industry experience and my interests render me suitable
for such a role. 

I have been working as Software Developer in the Computer Industry for 7 years,
I have worked on wide range of projects, in a variety of roles ranging from
technical support to an architect. I have also worked as an independent
consultant for companies assisting in the development of Internal Software
Infrastructure.  Over the years, I have developed various automation,
simulation, configuration management, and testing tools utilizing a variety of
technologies. I have mentored and led developers in modern design patterns,
implementation, debugging, documentation, and testing practices. The rich
repertoire of skills and experience that I have gained as a result of these
experiences would be immensely helpful to me as a teaching assistant and
research scholar.

My undergraduate studies were completed at the National Engineering College,
India, in the year 2002. Here, I majored in Computer Science and Engineering
and secured an aggregate of 77% in the University examinations, and was ranked
8th in my class of 60. I also undertook part-time courses in Artificial
Intelligence and Crypography at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2007.
I worked on interesting theoretical problems in Cryptography and did projects
involving various AI algorithms.

Very early in my career, I turned towards research and occupied myself with
interesting fundamental problems, the solutions for which, I have been able to
successfully translate into innovative product implementations. This is
supported by four Invention Disclosures that have been filed with USPTO during
my employment with Dell India Research and Development Center. 

I was also awarded "Co-Inventor for the Year 2007" for my Invention disclosures
in the Blu-Ray media, filed with USPTO, for my work on the content search in
Blu-ray. This efficient search algorithm using small memory footprint in an
embedded media exploits the peculiar nature of sample space data.

As a Senior Software Engineer at Akamai, I see the implementation of standard
Computer Science Algorithms and theories in practice. As Akamai was founded by
theoretical computer science experts, algorithms like Open Shortest Path First
and its derivatives are implemented as one of core technologies. I can
understand from other experts the value of specialization in computer science
education can help in building effective solutions.

I am involved with designing an asynchronous request handling server which can
fetch data on requests, the implementation of which required a thorough
understanding of concurrency and threading.

My interests for Research in Computer Science was further enhanced when I first
got involved with Python language development during the Google Summer of Code
program in 2007. I began working on enhancing the standard library modules.
With my regular contributions, I have now become the maintainer for urllib
module in Python language 3. I am inspired by the developers of Python, Guido
van Rossum, Martin Von Lowis and other contributors. Apart from the technical
skills, working a distrubute large scale project like Python has taught be
important social skills required to work with a diverse group of highly
expericed programmers and researchers. I have also presented a number of talks
related to my contributions at different Python conferences.

I plan to continue contributing to the python language while at my graduate
studies and research. Some of the areas in which I foresee potential work are
the networking library modules that handle ipv6 protocols and URL parsing
modules for Non English URLS as as defined Internationalized Resource
Identifiers Specifications and making python more suitable for concurrent
programming tasks.

I am especially interested in Research on technologies that are helpful to
people with disabilities. I have done research in Voice Recognition areas and
have used applications to provide a good computing interface for people with
disability so they can operate computers using voice.

I was honored with the best teacher award, in the year 2008, by the Spastics
Society of Karnataka,an NGO involved for development of disabled students,for
my volunteer work and for teaching Robotics to the students.

I studies the programs offered by _______ and found the exciting research being
undertaken by Computer Science Department. I understand that I can effectively
contribute further to the researches which are involved in language design

I request to you to consider my application for a PhD program at ______.
