String Basics
=============

The main tool Python gives us to process text is strings - immutable sequence
of characters. There are usually two kinds of strings: plain strings, which
contain 8-bit (ASCII) characters; and Unicode Strings, which contain Unicode
characters.

Python Strings
'I am a string'
"Even, I am a string too."

String values can be enclosed in either a single or Double quotes. The two
different kinds of quotes work the same way, but having both allows you to
include one kind of quotes inside of a string specified with the other kind of
quotes, without needing to escape them with the backslash character.


How does the \ character at the end signify continuation?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you want a breaks in the string, you can have a triple quoted string (either
single quote or double quote)

Strings are immutable, which means that no matter what operations you do on a
string, you will always produce a new string object, rather than mutating the
existing string.

In general, you can do anything to a string that you can do to any other
sequence, as long as it doesn't require changing the sequence, since the
strings are immutable.

What is the difference between string.split method and string.splitlines method? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful code:

list_of_lines = one_large.string.splitlines()

one_large_string = '\n'.join(list_of_lines)

Python's standard module string offers much of the same functionality that is
available from the string methods, packaged up as functions instead of methods.

string.maketrans

You can create a set of characters from a string.

list("python")
map(somefunc,"python")
map(lambda x:x,"python")
sets.Set("python")

The built-in function ord also accepts as its argument, a Unicode string of
length of one, in which case it returns a Unicode code value, up to 65535.
Which means that the encoding which is used is UTF-16. 

To make a Unicode string of length one from a numeric Unicode code value, use
the built-in function unichr.

How to reverse a string in Python?
----------------------------------

For sequences, the extended slicing with negative step can be used for
reversing. [::-1] There is reversed built-in function which can also be used
for reversing the words in a sentence.

But for reversing the characters in a string, if reversed is used, then a
''.join needs to be called.

The reversed returns an iterator, suitable for looping on or for passing to
some "accumulator" callable such as ''.join. It does not return a ready made
string.

builtins
--------
1. repr
2. ord
3. chr
4. unichr


What are the Different kind of sequences in python

lists, strings, unicode objects, tuples, array.arrays etc.


Quotes
------
The second version may appear to be clever, but it is a complimentary adjective
in the Python world, where simplicity and clarity are the core values.

EAFP - Its easier to ask forgiveness than permission. (EAFP). try/except is the
key tool in enabling the EAFP style.


What is a predicate?
--------------------
A term you can see often in discussions about programming is predicate, it just
means a function (or other callable object) that returns True or False as its
result. A predicate is said to be satisfied when it returns True.


string.translate and string.maketrans methods
---------------------------------------------

string.translate(s, table[, deletechars])

   Delete all characters from *s* that are in *deletechars* (if
   present), and then translate the characters using *table*, which
   must be a 256-character string giving the translation for each
   character value, indexed by its ordinal.  If *table* is ``None``,
   then only the character deletion step is performed.

string.maketrans(from, to)

   Return a translation table suitable for passing to ``translate()``,
   that will map each character in *from* into the character at the
   same position in *to*; *from* and *to* must have the same length.

   Note: Don't use strings derived from ``lowercase`` and ``uppercase`` as
     arguments; in some locales, these don't have the same length.
     For case conversions, always use ``str.lower()`` and
     ``str.upper()``.


Templating String functions are there.
--------------------------------------


What does u'\u2020' mean?
-------------------------

>>> print ord(u'\u2020')
8224


u'' is a unicode string object.
\u2020 is the unicode code point.

Questions
=========

Q: What is a facade design pattern?
A: facade is the french term for face. It is the Interface. Look at facade.py

Q: What is a closure?
A: closure is an inner function that refers to names (variables) that are local
to an "outer" function containing it.

Q: What is the difference between sets.Set or the builtin set type?

Q: What is a bound method?
A: Whenver a Python object supplies a method, you can get the method, already
bound to the object, by just accessing the method on the object.
L = ['a','b','c']
x = L.append

You encode a unicode string into a bytestring.


File Operations
---------------

A variant of 'r' that is sometimes precious is 'rU', which tells Python to read
the file in text mode with "universal newlines": mode 'rU' can read text files
independently of the line termination convention the files are using, be it the
Unix way, the Windows way or even the (Old) Mac way. (Mac OS X today uses Unix
for all intents and purposes, but releases of Mac OS 9 and earlier were
different).

Files have other writing related methods such as flush, to send any data being
buffered, and writelines, to write a sequence of strings in a single call.
However, write is by far the most commonly used method.

File reading is more common.
When read is called with an integer argument N, it reads and returns the next N
bytes (or all the remaining bytesm if less than N bytes remain)

Other methods worth mentioning are seek and tell, which support random access
to files. These methods are normally used with binary files made up of
fixed-length records.

Some Notes on Idiomatic Python
------------------------------

for line in input:
	process(line)

StringIO objects are plug-and-play compatible with file objects, so scanner
takes its three lines of text from an in-memory string object, rather than a
true external file.

Everywhere in Python, object interfaces, rather than specific data types are
units of coupling.

Often the data you want to write is not in one bit string, but in a list (or
other sequence) of strings. In this case, you should use the writelines method
(which despite its name, is not limited to lines and works just as well with
binary data as well as text files).

Calling writelines is must faster than the alternatives of joining the strings
into one big string (e.g, with the ''.join) and then calling write or calling
write repeatedly in a loop.

Calling close is even more advisable when you are writing to a file than you
are reading from a file.

Never trust your intuition in this matter - instead, always benchmark and
measure.

Counting tasks are notoriously prone to off-by-one errors.

Having a function accept an optional argument, while providing the most likely
value for the argument as the default value, is among the simplest and handiest
ways to implment this modest and often worthwhile kind of generalization.


struct.unpack - the format string - l stands for long.

With ZipFile, the flag is not used the same way when opening a file, and rb is
not recognized. The r flag handles the inherently binary nature of all zip
files on all platforms.

instead.
