========

unittest is Python's unit testing framework. It is similar to Junit the Java's
unittest framework written by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.

unittest supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for
tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests
from the reporting framework. The unittest module provides classes that make it
easy to support these qualities for a set of tests.
