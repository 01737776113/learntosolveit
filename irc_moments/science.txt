birkenfeld: fuzzyman: we want to get a beamline set up with a new technique we've been doing in Munich
fuzzyman: birkenfeld: sounds very cool - what is a beamline?
birkenfeld: fuzzyman: basically, the end of a neutron guide where neutrons come out of a hole.  the job is then to put something in front that makes science :)
