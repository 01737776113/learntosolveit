Programming Languages - C, Python, Java, Ruby, Scala
----------------------------------------------------

`Learn To Solve It`_ helps you learn programming in a straight forward
way.

Our approach is to choose a good programming book, code examples, solve the
exercises presented by the author, and explain the solution. We also include
many snippets which demonstrate features of the language, standard library
which can you use as building blocks for your project.

The programs can be run directly on `ideone`_ sandbox.

Please help us improve this website by adding programs, improving explanations
and collaborating via `Github`_ pull requests, which is possible directly from
these pages.
