When proxy server does not validate or modify any requests from the client and
passes the request directly to the server, it is called gateway or tunneling
proxy.

A Reverse proxy is a front end to cache and accelerate, in-demand resources.
The term 'transparent proxy' is mostly incorrectly used to mean 'intercepting proxy'
Because the client does not need to contact a proxy and cannot figure out if
that is proxied. (for e.g at Akamai). The transparent proxies can be
implemented using the Cisco's web cache control protocol.

Reverse proxy is installed on the neighbourhood of web-server.
Reverse proxy can be used for SSL Authentication; Load Balancing to the
transfer the load the any of the web servers.

iptables is a userspace application that allows a system administrator to
configure tables provided by Netfilter chains and rules it stores.
iptables refer to the kernel level component the Xtables, that does the actual
table traversal and provides an API for kernel level extensions.

iptables allow to define tables containing chains of rules.
There are three default chains, INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD in the filter table.

iptables-save -c > iptables-configuration.txt
iptables --flush
iptables-restore < iptables-configuration.txt

wget works through proxy if the environment variables are http_proxy and https_proxy.
