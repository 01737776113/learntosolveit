University of Toronto

Application for Ph.D in Computer Science, specializing in algorithms, theory of
computation, programming languages and distributed systems.

I am interested in pursuing research in Computer Science at University of
Toronto, specializing in algorithms and study of related fields such as theory
of computation, programming language design and distributed systems.  I have a
keen interest in developing algorithms for modeling and solving real world
problems.

As a PhD student, I would embark on a career devoted to development of computer
science. I would be engaged in research and teaching on how to develop better
software. My Industry experience and my interests would make me suitable for
such a role.

I attended National Engineering College in India where I majored in Computer
Science and Engineering in the year 2002. I secured 78% as the aggregate
percentage in the University examinations, and stood 8th in my class of 60. 

I undertook certificate courses in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography at
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2008. Those courses presented me with
an opportunity to work on interesting theoretical problems in Cryptography, and
study of mathematics involved in the various cryptographic algorithms. I
secured very good grades in those courses too. I developed two player games using
the A* algorithm.

As a software engineer in the Computer Industry for 7 years, I have worked on
wide range of projects, in a variety of role ranging from technical support to
an architect. I have also worked as a independent consultant for companies
assisting in development of Internal Software Infrastructure.

I have developed various automation, simulation, configuration management, and
testing tools utilizing a variety of technologies. I have mentored and led
developers in modern design patterns, implementation, debugging, documentation,
and testing practices. These skills and experience would be helpful to me as a
teaching assistant and a research scholar.

I have shown inclination towards research work and occupied myself with
interesting fundamental problems. I have also shown the ability to translate
the solutions for the problems into innovative product implementations.
This is supported by four invention disclosures that have been filed with USPTO
during my employment with Dell India Research and Development Center.

The content search in Blu-Ray is an efficient search algorithm using small
memory footprint in an embedded media. It exploits the peculiar nature of
sample space data. The result, which of interest to the user, are obtained in
an indirect and an efficient method of indexing subtitles rather than then
video frames.

I was awarded "Co-Inventor for the Year 2007" for my Invention disclosures in
the Blu-Ray media, which were filed with USPTO.

At Akamai, I have seen a certain good implementation of a standard computer
science algorithms and theories in practise. As Akamai was founded by
theoretical computer science experts, I see the implementation of the
algorithms like Open Shortest Path First implemented for finding an effective
route for packets across the systems as one of core technologies.  Cache
Oblivious Algorithms has developed a good load balancing algorithms for
distributed systems. And current focus on algorithms geared towards distributed
computing and video streaming, i.e. cloud architecture.

I have been involved with designing asynchronous request handling server which
can fetch data on requests. I have studied concurrency and threading for
implementing this solution.

I got involved with Python language development through Google Summer of Code
program in 2007. I worked on enhancing the standard library modules. With my
regular contributions, I have become the maintainer for urllib module in Python
language 3. Working on a large scale open source project involved a constant
research of Internet RFCs, and developing code adherent to strict standards. It
also helped me to understand the distributed nature of Open Source Development.

Apart from the technical skills, that important social skills that Python
language project has taught me is to be respectful and considerate of others
views. I have been inspired by developers of Python like Guido van Rossum,
Martin Von Lowis and other contributers who work compiler architecture,
floating pointing operations and performance improvement.

"Algorithms in Python" where I demonstrated all the common algorithm problems
in Python, explaining the complexity of each solution. I studied the kind of
sorting algorithm, timsort,  that is going inside the language interpretor for
sorting the elements in the language while providing higher level sort
interface to the programmer.

I plan to contribute to python language further through out the period of my
graduate studies and research. One the areas which I have recognized I will be
working on is the networking library modules that would handle ipv6 protocols
effectively and url parsing modules for Non English URLS as the IRI,
Internationalized Resource Identifiers, are becoming common, I would like gain
understanding of the Interpretor core and enhancements to it, making
improvements to it to make a Python a suitable language for distributed
computing tasks.

As I am planning to get into academia, my self-study of computer science
subjects involved attending to online lectures of Dr. Shai Simonson at Ars
Digita Uni website. I am inspired by his way of teaching computer science which
essentially focusses on gaining an insight and the right intuition for the
problem to come up with effective solutions.  I had undertaken the task of
solving all problem in K&R and other interesting problems in different
programming languages.

I have special interest in Research on technologies that are helpful to people
with disabilities.  I have studied and used Dasher for an alternative text
input system. Researched a lot in Voice Recognition and have used it for
providing a good computing interface for people which disability and who could
operate computers which voice.

I was honored with best teacher award by Spastics Society of Karnataka, for my
volunteer work and teaching Robotics to the students, in the year 2008.


I have come to know good programmers from University of Toronto through
Topcoder competitions and have also know Prof. Greg Wilson, through his books
likel "Beautiful Code" and his writings and snippets in Python.

I would be dependent on financial aid for my graduate studies, and PhD program
with its research assistance stipend will help to meet financial demands.
