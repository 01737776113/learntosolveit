Negotiation skills include being well prepared, showing patience, maintaining
integrity, avoiding the presumption of evil, controlling our emotions,
understanding the role of time pressures, breaking down bigger issues into
smaller ones, avoiding threats and manipulative tactics, focusing first on the
problem rather than on the solution, seeking for interest-based decisions, and
rejecting weak solutions. We shall visit these later on in the chapter. 

People are more willing to listen when they feel that they would have say in
the outcome.

Merit and justice still play a role in interest-based negotiation, but so does
exploring for solutions that meet mutual needs. 

Traditional negotiation approaches have sometimes been described as including
competition, yielding, withdrawal, or compromise. No one approach is always
right or wrong.
