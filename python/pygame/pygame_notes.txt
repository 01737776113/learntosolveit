The most important thing in pygame is the surface. One surface is special - the
one you create with pygame.display.set_mode() This is the 'display surface'
which represents the screen. Whatever you do will appear on the user's screen.
You can have only one of these, thats an SDL limitation and not the python one.

Other ways to create surfaces are image.load(), font.reader(), Surface().
Most important surface functions are blit, fill, set_at, and get_at.

If I have to create NxN matrix, should I create NxN rects in pygame is the
question.

A rect is simply a rectangle - defined only by the position of its top left
corner, its width and its height.
rect = pygame.Rect(10,10, 20,20)

* pygame.surface.Surface() What does it return or do?
* get_rect() what does it return? Co-ordinates?
