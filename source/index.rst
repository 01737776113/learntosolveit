   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.



`Learn To Solve It` is a platform to learn programming in a straight forward way.

My attempt is to choose a book and solve the exercises presented by the author in an easy to
understand manner. The emphasis is on understanding the problem solving approach.

The programs can be run directly on `ideone` sandbox and collaboration is most welcome
by sending a pull request via `Github`.
