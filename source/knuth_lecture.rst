Tree
====

A directed acyclic graph; i.e. a graph wherein there is only one route between
any pair of nodes, and there is a notion of "toward top of the tree" (i.e. the
root node), and its opposite direction, toward the leaves. A tree with n nodes
has n-1 edges.

Although maybe not part of the widest definition of a tree, a common constraint
is that no node can have more than one parent. Moreover, for some applications,
it is necessary to consider a node's daughter nodes to be an ordered list,
instead of merely a set.

As a data structure in computer programs, trees are used in everything from
B-trees in databases and file systems, to game trees in game theory, to syntax
trees in a human or computer languages.


Graph

A collection of nodes and edges.

Chordal Graph
=============

In the mathematical area of graph theory, a graph is chordal if each of its
cycles of four or more nodes has a chord, which is an edge joining two nodes
that are not adjacent in the cycle.

In graph theory, the term cycle may refer to one of two types of specific
cycles: a closed walk or simple path. If repeated vertices are allowed, it is
more often called a closed walk. If the path is a simple path, with no repeated
vertices or edges other than the starting and ending vertices, it may also be
called a simple cycle, circuit, circle, or polygon. A cycle in a directed graph
is called a directed cycle.
