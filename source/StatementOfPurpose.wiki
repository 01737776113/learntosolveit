I take up a particular problem and pursue it till I find a satisfying logical solution to the problem.

== Others ==
As an engineer, I was trained to solve problems. As a software developer, I designed tools to help others solve their problems.

My research interests lie in the design and implementation of advanced programming systems, incorporating expressive programming languages, efficient implementations, and supportive programming environments.
