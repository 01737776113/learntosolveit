Python Snippets
===============

The following project page contains the Python Snippets useful for various
tasks:

http://uthcode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/

You may checkout the programs using the command

:: 
    svn checkout http://uthcode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/ python-snippets

Source code is most-often commented.
My plan with uthcode is, it should eventually have a literal inclusion of
programs and explaination of the code.
