==================
Python Programming
==================

This is Uthcode's python programming section, which illustrates how to do
various programing tasks using python.

   algorithm_binary_search


Design
======

These programs demonstrate software design ascepts. These can be pretty
deep as, "why" it is done so is not obvious, but the program usually
demonstrates how it is done.

Software_engineering
====================

This is how software is built in real world. If your software needs to
make money, you will need to take care of these aspects.

Text Manipulation
=================

This category demonstrates text manipulation. It reads input and applies simple
text manipulation and provides the output. Many programs fall into this
category.
