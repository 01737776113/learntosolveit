   Squid is a proxy http server that speeds up getting pages from the
   internet by keeping copies of commonly accessed pages or graphics
   instead of downloading them each time. To install it:-

   1. From a root terminal type apt-get install squid

   2. Open gedit /etc/squid/squid.conf

   3. Find the TAG: visible_hostname and after the comments section add
   visible_hostname <hostname> where <hostname> is your machine's
   hostname.

   4. Check http_port is either set to 3128 or a port number that you can
   remember for configuring your browser.

   5. Close and save

   6. Type adduser squid and specify a password

   7. Restart squid by typing: /etc/init.d/squid restart

   8. Stop the service by typing /etc/init.d/squid stop

   9. Test it in debug mode by typing squid -z (which creates the cache
   files)

   10. Type squid -NCd10 to test squid in debug mode and leave it running.

   11. Open Firefox and type the URL localhost:3128 or whatever port you
   chose. It will fail to retrieve a page, but at the bottom it will
   confirm that the error is generated by squid.

   12. Back at the Terminal type CTRL-C to cancel the debug mode

   13. Start squid for real with /etc/init.d/squid start. It will start
   automatically from now on.

   14. To configure Firefox to use squid, go to Edit>Preferences and click
   Advanced.

   15. Click Network>Settings and then Manual Proxy Configuration. For
   http proxy, enter localhost and for port 3128 (or whichever port you
   chose).

   16. Then click OK and close the Preferences dialogue.

   17. Now go to any webpage. If you get the page, it's working!
