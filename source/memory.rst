Memory works best when we associate one thing with another. How often have you
heard yourself say in the middle of a conversation, "that reminds me"? One
thing reminds you of another. That is the principle of association.

This is a natural phenomenon, and without it you would have a very poor memory.
Once you understand how it works, you can put it to good use. For a more
in-depth discussion of this principle I recommend Harry Lorrayneâ€™s
Page-A-Minute Memory Book.

In your case, sitting for an exam reminds you of a previous occasion when you
didn't do as well as you would have hoped.

When you're sitting for an exam, or in any other situation where you are
reminded of your past failure, you can use this as a trigger to remind yourself
of another occasion when you succeeded. You can also use the memory as a
trigger to remind yourself to practice REBT.

For example, imagine yourself sitting an exam and the memory of your past
failure jumps into your head. Let this memory be a reminder to say something
along the lines of, "I want to do well on this exam so I will give it my full
attention; although passing the exam is important to me, there is no reason why
I absolutely must pass it; I'll be disappointed if I fail, but it won't be the
end of the world because I will survive and live to fight another day."

I hope this helps.

Regards,
