======================
C Programming Language
======================

The following project page contains the solutions to problems presented in
Kernighan and Ritchie.

http://uthcode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cprogs/

You may checkout the programs using the command

:: 

    svn checkout http://uthcode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cprogs/ cprogs 


Source code is most-often commented. My plan with uthcode is, it should
eventually have a literal inclusion of programs and explaination of the code.

.. literalinclude:: ../cprogs/helloworld.c
