Being a Good Developer
======================

*I wrote this essay at the request of my professor, for my college magazine.*

First of all, I would like to thank Dr.K. Ramar in providing me this
opportunity to write for the college alumni magazine. I graduated in the year
2002 in Computer Science and Engineering.This alumni magazine, I suppose would
be glanced through by my friends. I hope everyone finds something useful and
informative in this essay.

At the outset, I would like to inform you that I may not be the best person to
talk about this as I find myself lacking in various aspects, but still, when
pressed, I would like share what "being a good software developer" means to me.

Let's start with some simple questions.

**What does it mean to be a software developer?**

* Is it a person working for a fat pay-check compared to people working in
  other Industry?
* Or if you are in India, is it a person who visits "on-site" and makes a good
  exchange value over there?

Well, to me none of these mean being a software developer.  They completely
miss the point.

As an analogy, you can consider the example of cooking and a being a cook. You
may have a candid conversation with your mother on this topic.

**What does it mean to be a good cook?**

* A cook who is working in a 5 star hotel and earning more money than his
  friend in another restaurant?
* Or a cook who goes to work at restaurant in USA and serves there?

Well, none of these mean a cook, right? 

A good cook is someone who prepares tasty food. Who has devoted his mind to the
task of preparing food, so that he and his friends can enjoy good food.  A cook
might choose to make a business; but that is a separate aspect and his business
will flourish only if his food tastes good.

So, the same goes to a programmer. A programmer is someone who has devoted his
mind to developing software so that he and his friends can use the computer
effectively. A programmer may choose to make a business, but that is a separate
aspect and his business will flourish only if his software is happily usable
and people need it.

Let's switch gears and get into the "how" aspect of things.

**How do I become a good cook?**

* Learn cooking.
* Practice Cooking. 
* Concentrate while cooking and Enjoy cooking.

Now, the same question I pose it for programmer. 

**How do I become a good programmer?**

* Learn Programming. 
* Practice Programming. 
* Concentrate while programing. Enjoy working on others programs.

The process seems to be simple. It's only in the practice that we perfect
these.

And those are essentially my thoughts on being a good developer.

And for improving practice, let me share with you few points that might help
you become a better developer. Few things which have helped me so far.

**Learn to program:- Good Books**

* The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie.
* The Unix Programming Environment by Rob Pike.
* Understanding and learn programming languages, libraries and runtime, and this
  will make us fluent in programming that language. (வி. சு.)
* Suitable Operating System, Editors play a huge part. Choose one and stick to
  it. All you need to know is, those should serve you well to write programs.
  Ignore everything else.

**Practice Programming.**

* Solve the questions at the end of the chapters of the book that you read.
  (FWIW, I did with my project http://www.uthcode.com/ wherein I attempted to
  solve all the exercises of Kernighan and Ritchie.)
* Don't copy other programs. (I have to admit, I have copied, but after I
  understand, I try to uncopy them) (I have to aadmit, I have copied, but
  lafter I understand, I try to uncopy them and I would like to remove this
  parentised sentence in future)
* Start with toy programs. start writing small, simple and then you can move to
  bigger and more useful one later. ( வி. சு.)
* whenever you are in doubt write a small program; this saves lots of time, and
  easier (வி. சு.)

**Concentrating while programming.**

* This part requires some personal discipline, but find the area which appeals
  to you from within and you wont notice any effort that you are putting in.

**Enjoy Programming.**

* Have your favorite tool and know about it in and out. How Internet works, how
  google works, what is the design of your favorite software. Talk to people
  who have similar interests and discuss your ideas in open. Enjoy like you
  enjoy your favorite sport.


I think, these would help anyone, myself included if I follow through, to
become a better developer and enjoy the field.

Thank you,
