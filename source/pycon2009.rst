I presented a tutorial on "A Tour of Python Standard Library" at [http://us.pycon.org/2009/ Pycon 2009].

Here is some information on the same.

Proposal submitted for review
=============================

* A very brief Introduction to Python and Python Standard Library (20 minutes)
	- Introduction to Python. 
		- Recollecting topics from earlier tutorials.
	- Brief tour of Standard Library. 
		- Giving the audience an overall picture.
		- Explaining the "Batteries Included" philosophy.
	- Operating System Interface.
	- Command Line Arguments.
	- String Pattern Matching.
	- Internet Access
	- Multi-threading.
	- Logging.
	- Structure of the Python Standard Library in Python 2.6 and Changes to
	  Standard Library in Python 3.0.
	- How to get help about a particular library module.

* Built-In Modules and Exceptions. (30 minutes)
	- Example Program 1 which explains the built-in functions
		- abs
		- dir
		- enumerate
		- file
		- hasattr
		- setattr
		- getattr
	- Example Program 2 which explains the built-in types
		- and, or, not
		- int, float, long, complex
		- dict
		- iterator types.
		- File Objects.
	- Built-In Exceptions.
		- Example Program 3 explaining demonstrating Exceptions

* Operating Systems, Files and Directory Access. (30 minutes)
	- Overview of various modules present in this category. ( Tabular form)
	- Peek into certain modules in detail. My idea is to divide the 30 minute session into two snippets(15 minutes each), while effectively demonstrating certain modules usage and important methods in that module.  Other sections will follow the similar pattern.
		- os
		- time
		- shutil
		- glob
		- ConfigParser
		- logging
	- Changes in Python 3.0 for modules under this category.

* Internet Protocols and support -I . (10 minutes)
	- Overview.
	- Details of the Modules.
	- urllib, urlparse.
	- BaseHTTPServer

* Break timing.

* Internet Protocols and support -II . (20 minutes)
	- SimpleXMLRPCServer
	- smtpd
	- smtplib
	- Changes in Python 3.0 for modules under this category.

* Operating System Services and IPC. (30 minutes)
	- Overview.
	- threading and thread
	- signal
	- subprocess
	- Limitations - global lock in threading.
	- Changes in Python 3.0 for modules under this category.

* Development Tools (30 minutes)
	- Overview
	- pydoc.
	- doctest
	- unittest
	- 2to3
	- test and test_support.

* Extending the library module in your programs. (10 minutes)
	- 'duck-typing' explained.
	- Example Program explaining extending the ConfigParser module to read
	  a particular format of a Config file.
