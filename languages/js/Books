Introduction to Javascript.

JavaScript is an object oriented dynamic language; it has types and operators,
core objects, and methods. Its syntax comes from the Java and C languages, so
many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. One of the
key differences is that JavaScript does not have classes; instead, the class
functionality is accomplished by object prototypes. The other main difference
is that functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable
code and be passed around like any other object.

Let's start off by looking at the building block of any language: the types.
JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type.
JavaScript's types are:

	* Numbers
	* Strings
	* Booleans
	* Functions
	* Objects

Oh, and Undefined and Null, which are slightly odd. And Arrays, which are a
special kind of object. And Dates  and Regular Expressions, which are objects
that you get for free. And to be technically accurate, functions are just a
special type of object. So the type diagram looks more like this:

    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Object
          o Function
          o Array
          o Date
          o RegExp
    * Null
    * Undefined

And there are some built in Error types as well. Things are a lot easier if we
stick with the first diagram, though.


JQuery
------

There are any number of articles and blog posts out there that address some
aspect of jQuery. Some are phenomenal; some are downright wrong. When you read
an article about jQuery, be sure it's talking about the same version as you're
using, and resist the urge to just copy and paste â€” take the time to understand
the code in the article.
