Uthcode is a platform to learn programming in a straight forward way. Choose a
problem, solve it using the language, learn the syntax, explain the approach,
gather feedback and improve.

We have attempted to solve commonly occurring problems, frequently encountered
tasks which form building blocks of large projects in multiple languages.

The solution can easily be verified by running on ideone sandbox and
collabration is most welcome by sending a pull request via Github.
