String Basics
=============

The main tool Python gives us to process text is strings - immutable sequence
of characters. There are usually two kinds of strings: plain strings, which
contain 8-bit (ASCII) characters; and Unicode Strings, which contain Unicode
characters.

Python Strings
' I am a string'
" Even, I am a string too."

String values can be enclosed in either a single or double quotes. The two
different kinds of quotes work the same way, but having both allows you to
include one kind of quotes inside of a string specified with the other kind of
quotes, without needing to escape them with the backslash character.


How does the \ character at the end signify continuation?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you want a breaks in the string, you can have a triple quoted string (either
single quote or double quote)


Strings are immutable, which means that no matter what operations you do on a
string, you will always produce a new string object, rather than mutating the
existing string.

In general, you can do anything to a string that you can do to any other
sequence, as long as it doesn't require changing the sequence, since the
strings are immutable.

What is the difference between string.split menthod and string.splitlines method? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful code:

list_of_lines = one_large.string.splitlines()

one_large_string = '\n'.join(list_of_lines)

Python's standard module string offers much of the same functionality that is
available from the string methods, packaged up as functions instead of methods.

string.maketrans

You can create a set of characters from a string.

list("python")
map(somefunc,"python")
map(lambda x:x,"python")
sets.Set("python")


The built-in function ord also accepts as its argument, a Unicode string of
length of one, in which case it returns a Unicode code value, up to 65535.
Which means that the encoding which is used is UTF-16. 
To make a Unicode string of length one from a numeric Unicode code value, use
the built-in function unichr.

What does u'\u2020' mean?
-------------------------

>>> print ord(u'\u2020')
8224


u'' is a unicode string object.
\u2020 is the unicode code point.
