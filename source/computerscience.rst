Statement of Purpose
--------------------

1. New way of expressing things is research.
2. Teaching - I have conducted a number of programming contests and provided
   rigourous feedback to students, who attended the programming contests. 
3. Listened to Lectures of Shai Simonson and was inspired by his way of
   teaching computer science which essentially focussed on getting an insight
   and getting the right intuition of the problem and then spending time on the
   problems and coming up with solutions.

4. Self Study of number of subjects. For e.g, I had undertaken solving all
   problem in K&R and published those code in a website and constantly improved
   them.

5. Self Study of Computer Science in aduni.org, especially Prof Shai Simonson's
   lectures in Algorithms, Theory of Computation and Discrete Maths.

6. Interest in mathematics and problem solving. I have been constantly
   improving my topcoder ratings. I got to know about Univeristy of Toronto
   from topcoder winner only.
 
7. Gerry Sussman's lectures on Computer Science. The kind of thought process
   which is required to be an outstanding educator like Dr. Sussman.

8. Researched on concurrency concepts and selected a deferred based concurrency
   system for implementing a multi-threaded server as part of my work at
   Akamai.

9. Understanding the nature of knowledge. This interest was due my close
   association as a mentor for many students from Spastics Society of Karnataka
   and I could help them identify areas they were good at.  I taught Lego Mind
   Storms NXT kit and Alice Programming.

10. Research on technologies that are helpful to people. I have studied and
    used Dasher for an alternative text input system. Researched a lot in Voice
    Recognition and have used it for providing a good computing interface for
    people which disability and who could operate computers which voice.

11. Interests in different programming languages. C, C++. The languages that I
    have taught myself includem Python ( which I have gained sufficient
    expertise to become a core-contributor), Java, Perl, lisp, vim-script, shell
    script, brainfuck and Alice.  Common denominators within all the languages
    and the subtle differences in the languages.

12. Learnings from Python include - Be respectful of others and be honest.
    There are many technical skills I have learnt from the developers of
    Python, but following the Guido Van Rossum, lead in the project and his
    direction for other developers, these soft-skills come to an utmost
    important for working with a diverse group of developers.

13. Invention of Languages from historical perspective and listening to
    Dr.Gerry Sussman, I learn that development of language is the very essence
    of  human advancement. 

14. I have known some Industry researches who have decided to puruse PhD after
    a brief stint at work. They have returned back to Industry to contribute a
    lot to development of technologies. I am interested in research and like to
    understand more on topics concerning multiple industries, try to understand
    some of the problems and come up with satisfying solutions that could be
    helpful to many people.

15. Study of Certificate Courses at Indian Institute of Science, that gave me
    time to do an sincere work with problems and solutions, have an idea on how
    Cryptography is used in Industry and work out the mathematics behind the
    Cryptography Problems as part of the course also utilize my programming
    skills to implement two person games using AI algorithms.

16. I have stood 8th in the class of 65 and what I remember most of my college
    is, I stood first in many programming contests and all my programming
    assignments were correct.

17. I have earned four Patent assignments related to my work.  The technologies
    were devised/Invented 3-4 years before any of the base technology ever
    reached the mainstream media.

18. Used accessibility software like sceen magnifier.

19. Uthcode is project which is  part of my life and working on it for than 6
    years. 

20. Patent on Distributed Download mechanism in Blu Ray is a techology
    adoptation in Blu-ray with a some of exsiting networking algorithms.

1. A Good Computer Scientist will combine both practise and theory to explore
   the truth.

2. Career devoted to the development of Computer Science.

3. I find the distinct relationship between the various areas of computer
   science and I specifically find interests in Algorithms, Theory of
   Computation, Distributed Systems and Networking.

4. My specific areas of interests are Theory of Computation, Discrete
   Mathematics and Algorithms. I find that Theory of Computating and Discrete
   Mathematics are very related and it is the underlying topics to understand
   which thread across in many of the higher level subjects in Computer
   Science.

5. The various practical problems that we face in text processing, in
   programming, writing text parsers are easily modelled in theory of
   computation. The Regular expressions were common fields for person working
   on text processsing problems, and understandin the regex engines helps model
   the regular languages and Finite Statement automata.

6. Even while writing prototypes for good concurrent systems, the theory of
   computations comes handy where we tend to write distinct finite state
   automata machines and try to follow the logic in the model and when
   satisfied with the model, we go ahead with the implementation in the
   program.

7. I have seen the real world application of the Open Shortest Path first
   algorithm in the packet routing.

8. Very interesting to note the power of dynamic programming in effectively
   solving the problem of diffs in version managemnt systems.

9. Finite automata and their probablistic counter parts. Markov chains are used
   in speech recognition systems.

10. How exponential time complexity programs can be brought down to polynomial
    time complexity using Dynamic programming strategies.  It is further
    realzied while participating in the programming contests, where if you
    could identify the problem strategy and the trick involved, then the
    solution becomes incredibly simple.

11. Graduation problem - Bipartite match problem using mincut max flow
    strategy.

12. Being firm on the theoritical concepts, and learning the latest
    technologies and relate them both.

13. Research and teaching on how to make better software.

14. I like finding solutions to problems that are both practical and elegant. 

15. As an undergraduate, I attended National Engineering College in India where
    I majored in Computer Science, I secured 78% as the aggregate percentage
    had won many programming contests.

16. One benefit of working in the Industry is that it provided a good
    environment to study software systems and software engineer. The training
    to build a releasable working software with plan and good team
    communication.

17. Graph algorithms in computer networking and routing. They become all the
    more important as distributed systems are growing and efficient
    communications between the computer systems invariably have some good graph
    theory associated with it.

18. Debugging and Path profiling algorithms use Graph algorithms.

19. Are two graphs equal, it is a graph iso-morphism problem.

20. Presented a topic on "Algorithms in Python" where I demonstrated all the
    common algorithm problems in Python, explaining the complexity of each
    solution. I studied the kind of sorting algorithm, timsort,  that is going
    inside the language interpretor for sorting the elements in the language
    while providing higher level sort interface to the programmer.

1. Multi threading programming, asynchronous networking programming, threading.

2. Interest in Global Interpretor lock of the Python and presented a topic on
   "understand gil" to the scientific python community.

3. I have an inclination towards research and occupying myself with interesting
fundamental problems, and I also have certain ability to translat the answers
to the fundamental problems to more concrete ones in the products and come out
with new innovations. This is supported by four inventions that have been filed
with USPTO by my former employer Dell. They were important contributions even
in the business, because only 4 out of 600 people in the group had a track
recording of having 4 or more patents.

4. I plan to contribute to python language further through out the period of my
   graduate studies. One the areas which I have recognized I will be working on
   is the networking library modules that would handle ipv6 protocols
   effectively and url parsing modules for Non English URLS as the IRI
   (Internationalized Resource Identifiers are becoming common), I would like
   gain understanding of the Interpretor core and enhancements to it, making
   improvements to it to make a Python a suitable language for distributed
   computing tasks.

5. Interests and teaching using Visual Programming Languages like Alice and
   Mindstorms NXT. The concepts of programming are same, but it increases the
   ease of programming systems. It affects the way we approach programming.

6. Mentored and led developers in modern design patterns, implementation,
   debugging, documentation, and testing practices.
7. Developed various configuration management, simulation, and testing tools
   utilizing a variety of technologies.
8. I was awarded "Co-Inventor for the Year 2007" for my Invention disclosures
   in the Blu-Ray media, which were filed with USPTO.
9. I was honored with best teacher award by Spastics Society of Karnataka, for
   teaching Robotics to the students, in the year 2008.
10. Who Dares wins! An algorithm game where I studied the A* algorithms from
    Peter Norvig's books, studied the lisp implementations for N puzzle game,
    and converted them into a two player game using Python and Pygame, SDL
    library in python. This visulaization of the algorithm helped the players
    appreciate the computer moves.

11. The Content Search in Blu-Ray is an efficient search algorithm using small
    moemory because it is an embeded media, it uses the nature data for
    implmenting the search. The results which of interest to the end user are
    obtained in an indirect and an effecient by indexing subtitles rather than
    then video frames.

12. I, Senthil Kumaran, am applying to University of Toronto, for the admission
    to Masters program, in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization
    in the field of algorithms.

13. Deep interests in specific fields in computer science and language design,
    working with smart people and desire to work on hard problems in computer
    science has motivated me to apply for PhD program.

14. My academic record has been consistently good and secured top position in
    my class through out the engineering education.

15. At Akamai, I have seen a really good implementation of a standard computer
    science algorithms and theories. As this company was formed by theoretical
    computer science experts, I see the implementation of the algorithms like
    Open Shortest Path first implemented for finding an effective route for
    packets across the systems.

16. Cryptography systems and Security architecture to prevent any attacks on
    the Internet. It is standard model in the text books, but understood and
    implemented very clearly within the company.

17. Cache Oblivious Algorithms has developed a good load balancing algorithms
    for distributed systems.

18. I would be dependent on finantial aid for my graduate studies, and PhD
    program with its research assistance stipend will help to meet financial
    demands.

19. Akamai, is not a content cache network or CDN, but interesting algorithms
    in effective path finding (OSPF), and challenges in handling software
    management and deployment on a distributed network (consisting of 50,000
    computers) play a major role. I have studied the design behind software and
    have found solid theoritical underpinnings for the design.

20. For my own project of desinging an asynchronous requesting handling server
    to for distributed log collection from the network, I used a very standard
    programming model, a reactor pattern, and asynchornous programing using
    deferreds. The twisted framework provided a neat implmentatin of these has
    been very stable.

1. I have had several opportunities to do research.
2. My career after graduate school is to pursue research in academedia or in
   Industrial Labs. I would like to solve the persisting problems and also see
   through the application of the solutions for larger benefit.
3. I take up a particular problem and pursue it till I find a satisfying
   logical solution to the problem.
4. Research Interest in design and implmentation of advanced programming
   systems, incorporating expressive programming languages, efficient
   implementations and supportive programming environments.

   development.  I have gained expertise in certain programming languages like
   Python and C have studied a other many programming languages like C++, Alice
   and esoteric languages. 

6. Independent thinking experimentation and deriving results. 

7. Being a Python Core developer, I have the value of mutual respect and being
   honest in the code from the fellow python developers and Guido van Rossum
   who is a the lead of the project.

   years, I got engaged with students and got interested that I could  utitlize
   my technical expertise in developing solutions for them. That project took
   more than 4 years to complete, where I first tried the different solutions
   in Voice Recognition and Dasher. I was able to successfully design a
   solution students who could operate their computer independently using
   Voice. The technology of voice recognition has improved a lot over past 3
   years, I know how certain technologies can be helpful as an assistive
   technology. I have also studied the kind of research work that is involved
   in developing those technologies, like Brown university is involved with
   Camera Mouse and the Dasher which is a product of Inference Group, UK uses
   Statistical Markov chain processes in word prediction.

Preparation Notes
=================
 
* If thoughts are properly handled, then you can study more and be tired less too - 8th Aug.
* If you keep a problem prolonged without doing something about it, you might
  keep missing it and it might 'tend' to become harder than it was initially.

Physical Science Monologues 
===========================

This is the list of twelve best physical sciences monologue of the 20th century
according to American Scientist. Found this at
`TAOCP<http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Euno/taocp.html>`_ page.

* Dirac on Quantum 
* Einstein on relativity
* Mandelbrot on fractals
* Pauling on the chemical bonds

* von Neumann and Morgenstein on Game Theory
* Wiener on Cybernetics
* Woodward and Hoffman on Orbital Symmetry
* Feynman on Quantum Electrodynamics

* Einstein's collected papers.
* Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming


Unix Operating System Documents
===============================

http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/


Theory of Computation
=====================

* A language is called a regular language if some finite automaton recognizes it.
* What is finite automata?

A finite automata is a 5-tuple (Q, E, ∂, q, F), where:

1) Q is a finite set called the states.
2) E is a finite set called the alphabet
3) ∂: is  Q x E -> Q is the transition functions.
4) q belongs to Q is the start state.
5) F belongs to Q is the set of accept states.

* Regular Operations are union, concatenation and star.

* Operator is a unary operator; it attaches any number of strings in A together
  to get a string in the new language.

* Generally speaking a collection of objects is closed under some operation, if
  applying the operation to the members of the collection still returns an
  object in that collection.

P vs NP problem
===============

Suppose that you are organizing housing accommodations for a group of four
hundred university students. Space is limited and only one hundred of the
students will receive places in the dormitory. To complicate matters, the Dean
has provided you with a list of pairs of incompatible students, and requested
that no pair from this list appear in your final choice. This is an example of
what computer scientists call an NP-problem, since it is easy to check if a
given choice of one hundred students proposed by a coworker is satisfactory
(i.e., no pair taken from your coworker's list also appears on the list from
the Dean's office), however the task of generating such a list from scratch
seems to be so hard as to be completely impractical. Indeed, the total number
of ways of choosing one hundred students from the four hundred applicants is
greater than the number of atoms in the known universe! Thus no future
civilization could ever hope to build a supercomputer capable of solving the
problem by brute force; that is, by checking every possible combination of 100
students. However, this apparent difficulty may only reflect the lack of
ingenuity of your programmer. In fact, one of the outstanding problems in
computer science is determining whether questions exist whose answer can be
quickly checked, but which require an impossibly long time to solve by any
direct procedure. Problems like the one listed above certainly seem to be of
this kind, but so far no one has managed to prove that any of them really are
so hard as they appear, i.e., that there really is no feasible way to generate
an answer with the help of a computer. Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin formulated
the P (i.e., easy to find) versus NP (i.e., easy to check) problem
independently in 1971. 


A problem is of type P, if it can be solved using an algorithm whose running
time grows no faster than some fixed power of number of symbols required to
specify the initial data.


Theory of Computation 1.1 
=========================

1.1 Write formal descriptions of the following sets.
----------------------------------------------------

a. The set containing the numbers 1, 10 and 100.

A = {1,10,100}

b. The set containing all integers that are greater than 5.

SET = { n | n ∈ Z and n > 5 }

c. The set containing all natural numbers that are less than 5.

SET = { n | n ∈ N and n < 5 }

d. The set containing the string aba.

SET = {aba}

e. The set containing an empty string.

SET = { ∊ }

f. The set containing nothing at all

SET = ∅

1.2 Let A be the set {x, y, z} and B be the set {x, y}
------------------------------------------------------

a. Is A a subset of B? FALSE.

b. Is B a subset of A? TRUE.

c. What is A ∪ B?  Answer: A

d. What is A ∩ B?  Answer: B

e. What is A x B?  Answer: {(x,x), (x,y), (y,x), (y, y), (z, x), (z, y)}

f. What is the power set of B?

Answer: { ∅, {x},{y},{x,y}}

1.3 If A has a elements and B has b elements, how many elements are in AxB? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A x B has a*b elements. A x B stands for cartesian product which is formed as set
of tuples taking each element from each set.

So for 2 x 2 set.
{a,b} x {c, d} = { (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d)} Thus there are 4 elements.


1.4 Description
---------------

1.4 Examine the following formal descriptions of sets so that you understand which members they contain . Write a short informal English description for each set.

1.5 If C is set with c elements, how many elements are in the power set of C? Explain your answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{x, y}  = { ∅, {x}, {y}, {x,y}}

{x, y, z} =  { ∅, {x} , {y}, {z}, {x, y} , {y, z}, {x, z}, {x, y, z} }

{a, b, c, d} = { ∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {c,a,d}, {d,a,b}, {a,b,c,d}}

Answer: cC0 + cC1 + cC2 + cC3 + ... + cCc


Take c = 4
Answer = 4C0 + 4C1 + 4C2 + 4C3 + 4C4 = 16

Actually it is 2^n^. I have to find the proof for this.

PROBLEMS 
--------

1.10 The error is dividing by (a-b) which is 0 because we assume a = b. Dividing by zero is not-defined and hence the proof is not valid.

1.11 The Induction Step is wrong. After assuming that H=K+1 are of same color instead of proving mathematically that K+n can be true, it goes about sub-classing the same set and without proceeding to prove a generality.

1.12 Every graph with 2 or more nodes contains 2 nodes that have equal degrees. 

Each edge contributes equally to 2 adjoing nodes or when there is not a edge,
the two seperate nodes have an equal lose.  Taking both the situations into
account, for a given graph with 2 or more nodes, there are 2 nodes that have
same degree.

1.13

Clique of a graph is subgraph in which every 2 nodes are connected by an edge.
Anti-Clique is the subgraph in which every 2 nodes are not connected by an
edge. This is also called as independent set.  Show that every graph with
n-nodes contains either a clique or an anti-clique with at-least 1/2log2 n
nodes.

Answer: This is Ramsey's therom. Generalized for k=2. For which the minimum number of
nodes required is 3.

* Have two sets m and n.
* Take each node in the graph and if the degree is greater than 1/2 number of
  remaining nodes add to set m else add to set n.
* Take all the nodes that are connected to m and add it set m.
* All the nodes that are not connected add to the set n.
* In this way, we have a clique in m and anti-clique or an independent set in n.

1.14

Theorem 1.25

P(t) = P*M^t - Y ( M^t - 1) / (M - 1)

P is the principal sum
I is the interest rate
Y is the monthly payment.
M is convenience term for writing M = 1 + I/12

This problem can be solved by using a calculator.

Curious
-------

There are 2^903 ways to arrange red, green strings among 43 pegs so each pair
is either connected by red string or by a green string.

1) Ramsey Theorem:
http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mileti/museum/ramsey.html

In the book proof of Ramsey Theorem, it divides the nodes into connected
(forming cliques) and disconnected (forming anti-cliques), but checking if the
degree is greater than 1/2 of no. of remaining nodes, is not understood. (It is
like is having a theorem and and following a procedure in order to prove the
theorem, there is no counter intuitive example given).

Theory of Computation 
---------------------

Video Lecture 2: Closure and Non-Determinism 
--------------------------------------------

* FSM are closed under reversal.
* Convert a Non Deterministic FSM to a Deterministics FSM, the example of every 1 followed by two zeros.
* Reversing a machine, wherein final state is the start state and arrows get reversed and start state is the new final state.
* Theory of Computation Folklore. To convert to the minimize the Deterministic FSM   
  * Reverse the Machine ( This would make it Non Deterministic)
  * Convert to Deterministic FSM
  * Reverse the machine (Again Non Deterministic FSM)
  * Covert to Deterministic FSM again. *This would be minimal machine.* I kind of trust Shai Simonson's word on that. :)
* The above method of minimizing involves DFA to NFA and it is exponential time complex.
* There are better methods using Polynomial Time Complexity using Dynamic Programming Strategy.
* Union of two machines using NFA.
* Intersection of two machines ( Using De Morgan's law. WOW!!!) But that is
  costly again, you can do it by working it out with pair or states as in
  cartesian product of the two machines. 
   * Union means the set of accept states are either of the accept states in M1
     and M2.
   * Intersection means that set of accept states are BOTH the accept state in
     M1 and M2.
* Union, Intersection and Complement. Any two of the operations are enough and the third one is guaranteed.
* Complement Operations means changing 1s to 0s.
* Finding Intersection using Non Determinism is difficult, because Non
  Determinism does not mix well with OR operations, It mixes well with AND
  Operation.
* NFA ~ DFA ~ REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ~ NFA ( They form a nice group).
* Regular Grammars ~ DFA
* Trying to represent 0^n^1^n^ can be represented by FSM??
* Well, if I try it, equal number of 0s and 1s can be represented by FSM, but
  equal number of 0s followed by equal number of 1s ( this involves counting)
  cannot be represented by FSM.
* Anything that involves counting cannot be represented by FSM.
* The FSM can also be tested using Pumping Lemma, because they test a particular kind of regularity.
* Regular sets can be pumped out at Regular Intervals and are identified by pumping lemma. 
* Thus Pumping lemmas are yet another test for FSM..

Pumping Lemma
-------------

* How to minimize the finite state machine in O(nlgn) times. Aho, Ullman Paper. Fun programming problem.
* Pumping Lemma - to prove that a set is not acceptable by the FSM.
* Regular Set -> ( Implies) Pumping property; ~ Pumping Property (Implies) -> ~ Regular Set.
* If L is a regular set, it has a string long enough that is longer than the number states in the set, then it has a symbol that loops, then looping that symbol results in the string in the same set (recognizable by the language).
* The four quantifiers represent the pumping property.
* How to show that it is not true? 
* If you push not sign through quantifiers, it changes universal to existential and vice versa.
* Not of pumping property. For any n, there exists z in L such that |z| >= n, there exists v,w,x such that z=vwx and |vw| <= n and |w| >= 1 and there exists i >0 vw^i^x is not in L.
* Converse of Point 3 is not true. A set having pumping property does not mean that the set is a regular set. It is not a iff property. 
* A set of Palindromes, dont satisfy the pumping property. 
* Palindrome - Latin for running backwards.
* In the pumping lemma proof for palindrome, for sets = K, chosing 0^K^10^K^ forces the opponent to choose the looping in 0, because of the property that |vw| <= K. :) Palindromes are not a regular set.
* While a bad choice of z = 0^K/2^1^K/2^ would make the loop to be in 1 and it would result in a palindromes. 
* Palindromes cannot be described by regular expressions.
* 0^k\^2\^^ is not a regular set, because k can be 0.
* 0^k^ k = composite. Pick up z=0^2n^. z = vwx. It has a pumping property but it is not regular.
* 0^p^ p = prime is not regular.  These are complements of one another.
* That is the idea of closure.
* Diagnolization - Have you known it yet?
* Can a FSM recognize one of its own kind? It is not regular.
* Turing machines can recognize FSMs. Turing machines can recognize their own
  kind, but cannot identify properties of their own kind.
* ->RE->DFM->NDFM  ( Linear Grammer) - Grammer way of looking at set.
* Productions of Grammer to generate some strings.  Using the productions is
  called derivations and get a string.
* Linear Grammers. Single Capital Letter on the LHS, the RHS consists of a
  small letter(terminal) and a capital letter ( non terminal). The terminal
  comes in the left, it is a left Linear Grammar.
* Context Free Grammer - A Single Non Terminal Symbol on the Left and Right
  side can be anything. Linear Grammer is a subset of Context Free Grammer. 
* Left linear grammer and right linear grammer are the same. One can be
  converted to another.
* Grammers by their nature are non-deterministic.

Big O Notation
==============

* Big O denotes a limiting behavior of function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, usually in terms of a simpler function.
* Big O notation allows its users to simplify functions in order to concentrate on their growth rate. Different functions with same growth rate may be represented with the same big O notation.
* Description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function; associated with big O are several related symbols o, Ω, ω, and Θ to describe other kinds of bounds on the asymptotic growth rate.
* Formal Description:
   f(x) = O(g(x)) as x -> ∞ 
* T(n)  ∊ O(n^2^) - That is T(n) has n^2^ time complexity.
* O(n^c^) and O(c^n^) are very different. The latter grows much, much faster, no matter how big the constant c is (as long as it is greater than one).
* Changing units may or may not affect the order of the resulting algorithm. Changing units is equivalent to multiplying the appropriate variable by a constant wherever it appears. For example, if an algorithm runs in the order of n^2^, replacing n by cn means the algorithm runs in the order of c^2^n^2^, and the big O notation ignores the constant c^2^. This can be written as c^2^n^2^ ∊ O(n^2^) . If, however, an algorithm runs in the order of 2^n^, replacing n with cn gives 2^cn^ = (2^c^)^n^. This is not equivalent to 2^n^ in general.

Computer Architecture
---------------------

Make a list of 10 general-purpose processors including the details like clock speed, word size and manufacturer.

::

        ||*uP*||Clock Speed || Word Size || Manufacturer||
        ||Intel Core i7 EE || 3.33 `GHz` || 64 bit(bus-size) || Intel||
        ||AMD K10 || 3.1 `GHz` || 64 bit || AMD ||
        ||ARM 11 ||528 `MHz` ||32 bit ||ARM||
        ||Cyrix 5x86 || 133 `MHz` || 32 bit || Cyrix||
        ||DEC 21-40535-04||275 `MHz` ||64 bit ||DEC ||
        ||IDT Win Chip `W2A` ||300 `MHz` ||32 bit ||IDT||
        ||Motorola 68060 ||75 Mega Hz ||32 bit ||Motorola||
        ||NS 320 16 N -10 ||10 Mega Hz ||32 bit ||National Semiconductor||

        ||C7 D || 2 Giga Hz || 32 bit || VIA||
        ||Crusoe TM 5800 || 933 Mega Hz || 64 bit || Transmeta||



The number of bits a CPU can process at once; word size is usually the same as
the width of the CPU's external data bus, but sometimes is smaller.
Justify that CPU in personal computer is a general purpose processor.

 * It is not just for sine and cosine but can do a large number of small scale mathematical calculations.
 * It can fairly handle the graphic requirements.
 * It can do multi-tasking to satisfy the users requirements.


In a mathematical sense, only three operations are needed to compute any
computable function: add one, subtract one and branch if a value is non-zero.


Minimizing Finite State Machines 
--------------------------------

* All FSM can be minimized to a unique FSM. Cool. :)
* Not true for turing machine or middle level (push down machine) programs.
* Decision algorithms about FSM are possible because of its property of minimize.
* Cave example, Dungeon and Dragons. 
* Minimising FSM
* Make it such a way if one state is distinguishable from another.
* NC_2_ are the number of pair of states for N states.
* Draw a Matrix and X each pair of states which are distinguishable.
* Proceed on 0,1 and on each pair and note the dependency and mark them for backtracking.
* The amount of backtracking, determines the size of the string that distinguishes it.
* Based on the number of X, which are number of states which are indistinguishable from one-another, we can collapse them to one state.
* That is the basis of equivalence relation.
* In the matrix, seperate the distinguishable states into sets.  (AFDC) and (BE).
* That is kind of Non Determinisitic Machine.
* Minising FSM is commomly used, when you write the opcodes and then you want
  to minimize it implement it in the architecture.
* Dependency Graph drawing it from the Matrix.
* Any kind of search over the graph from the dependency graph will give
  depdency. the 2(nC2) = n(n-1)
* Funny way, suttle way to represent and work with the graph and transmitting
  the operation with back arrows.
* Backtracking it easy to put an X than say searching if the backtracked note
  already has an X.
* That was a reduced one for "Every string that does not have 1 in the second
  position".
* Graph Traversal vs Diagonalization method. Complexity analysis. The
  Diagonalization involves backtracking. But that the worst case of
  backtracking for going to every single state for every single value is never
  going to happen. Because in each loop we go about cancel symbols.
* Different way of doing it by a student. Do you stay in the same group (ABCD) and or different group (EF).
* Hopcraft and Ullman for reducing the FSM in nlogn times.
* Switch Gears:  What questions can we answer about FSM?
* Lex: Describe the FSM and given the Input string and it says whether it
  accepts or not.
* We can answer almost everything about FSM.
* Membership question.
* Are two FSM equal? Graph Isomorphism problem - Given two graphs are they
  same. (You got to relabel the graph and see if there is a set of labels that
  match. But that takes N! times)
* Start with a graph and re-label the other nodes till you get a match.
* If two FSMS are equal, if you calculate their difference A-B = 0. 
* A-B = A ⋂ ~B
* Language is infinite. Look for a cycle, and if there is a state which goes to Final State and if it does, then it is infinite. easier way, convert to RE.
* No 2 RE have smallest RE. To figure if two RE are same, is NP Complete.
* SET Theory and Graph Theories are coming into picture here.
* Is a Regular set A contained in Regular set B? 
* Remind of the Discrete Math. Intersection is AND, Union is OR, Complement is NOT.
* A ⊆ B means A -> B (A implies B). 
* Decidable means can be done or not?
* Only thing that can be done from next level is membership problem.
* There are not any interesting undecidable questions in FSM.
* Any non-trivial property of turing machine is undecidable.
* A Trival property of Turing machine is How many states it has?

Asymptote is a tangent to a curve at infinity. Something that is asymptotic
relates to an asymptote, which is defined as "A Line whose distance to a given
curve tends to zero."

Something asymptotic refers to a limiting behaviour based on a single variable
and a desired measure.  A common notation that removes constants is called Big
O notation, where O means "order of".  Big O denotes the upper bound, how much
the time complexity will grow. If we say that a function is O(N) then if N
doubles, the funtion's time complexity at most will double.

I don't understand this aspect:
But because the array is split in half each time, the number of steps is always
going to be equal to the base-2 logarithm of N, which is considerably less than
O(N).

http://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/jsw_home.aspx

Big-O is not a mathematical function. It has no inverse.

The Art of Sorting 
==================

* C's qsport and C++ std::sort and std::partial_sort.
* Its beneficial to understand what algorithms are available, what their advantages and disadvantages are, and how to implement your own algorithm that's custom tailored to your data if the need arises.
* To sort or not to sort. That's the question, Is'nt it?
* It should be really obvious that Upper Bound of any sorting algorithm is infinite, as long as it eventually sorts the items.
* The Lowest possible bound for most sorting algorithms is Ω(N logN).
* There must be as many leaves as the permutations of the algorithm to be correct.
* It is possible to meet the safe lower bound of O(N) for sorting.
* Selection Sort is not a viable option for things that come through input an
  stream or random number generator. The array has been completely filled in
  before it is sorted.
* In the selection sort, if you swap the items (the largest vs n), then you
  displace the items of their original relative order.
* But thats not the case when you kind of shift the items one after the other,
  so it remains stable in this case, albeit taking a lot of space and time.
* Stable Selection Sort. Understand it.
* Priority Queue can be used to do a selection sort. The best known priority
  queue implmentation is done with a max_heap.
* Max Heap is a complete binary tree, wherein the children of a node cannot be larger than the parent.
* In a valid max heap, the largest item is the root of the tree.
* Heap Sort has the worst case as the same complexity as the average case.
* Array can be coverted to a heap, wherein for each index i, the child nodes are i*2 + 1 and i*2 + 2.
* The relative order of children in the Heaptree is irrelavent.( Funny, because it is binary tree)
* Insertion sort is blazingly fast on arrays that are sorted or partially sorted. That makes it a good one to use as the last part of quick sort.
* What is knuth sequence?

Lecture 5 Context Free Languages 
================================

* FSM -> CFL
* CFL, Inside they are DPDM and Outside they are NDPM.
* CFL are equivalent to NDPM.
* DPDM are equivalent to LR(K) grammers.
* LR(K) grammars are subset of CFL.
* LR(K) grammers are the one most compilers are built from.
* Context Free Grammers are Grammers that have a single Capital Letter on the LHS.
* S-> 0S1 | e
* S-> 0S1 | SS | e
* If there are more than two parse trees, its bad, bad, bad.
* trees give a semantic interpretation in the programming languages.
* Grammar is AMBIGUOUS if any string has two parse different trees.
* Its undecidable to figure out if the grammer is ambigous or not.
* ``S-> S+S | S*S |0..9 is ambiguous.``
* ``S->(S+S) |(S*S) | 0..9``
* Grammers tend to challenge people more than machines do.
* Use recursive idea and find the grammar inductively.
* Semantic meaning for the non-terminal.

::
   S -> 0A | 1B | e
   A -> 1S |0AA
   B -> 0S |1BB

* Ambiguity is at AA.
* Recursive example of grammar.

::
         S-> SAB | e
         A-> 0S1 | e
         B-> 1S0 | e

* Single Tree Grammers ( But the trees may get pruned at different levels)
* This is equal number of 0s and 1s.
* We prove by induction because they are recursive.
* You cannot decide anything about the Grammer, except if that accepts Nothing! ( Turing machine can't do that too).
* There is a pumping lemma for Context Free Languages.
* 0^n^1^n^0^n^ cannot be generated by Context Free Languages.
* Give more power and make it Context Sensitive, then the above strings can be generated.
* Context Sensitive Grammers look very much like machines.

Video 6. Relationship with Compilers 
------------------------------------

* Compiling a programming language.
* Chomsky Normal Form.
* Convert the Context Free Language to Chomsky normal form.
* Motivation for Chomsky Normal Form. Every string of length n is derivable
  from (2n-1) steps.
* Try every simple production to the depth of 2n-1, if it does not success it
  fails. If 3 nodes then 3^(2n-1)^ choices exists. It is decidable, but
  exponential time algorithm.
* Chomsky Normal Form helps with Proof of Pumping Lemma for Context Free
  Languages.
* Context Free Grammars are equivalent to Non Deterministic Push Down Machine.
  This equivalence becomes easy to prove of the grammar is in Chomsky Normal
  form.
* Every CFG has an "equivalent" NPDM.
* Push Down Machine is a FSM which can push and pop symbols from a stack.
* Good Algorithm for membership in Context Free Grammar. The CYK O(n^3^)
  algorithm for membership, this is easy if the Grammar is in Chomsky Normal
  Form. But there are linear grammars for this.

I discovered later that I wasn’t even a very good C programmer, hiding my
ignorance of structures, _malloc( ) and free( ), setjmp( ) and longjmp( ),_ and
other “sophisticated” concepts, scuttling away in shame when the subjects came
up in conversation instead of reaching out for new knowledge.

* The concept of implementation hiding cannot be overemphasized.

Questions to Ask
----------------

Should I apply for Ph.D or M.S?

My aspiration is to pursue Ph.D because I have an inclination towards research
and like solving problems especially going into depth with in a small area.
But, as I have only Bachelors degree, I am trying to figure out what should I
prove in order for universities to recognize and admit me into Ph.D program. 

I would not hesistate to do a Masters in passing, if there is any objective
requirement to for it in order to pursue research in that particular area. But
I would be able to evaluate it best after considering the cases like finance. 

About me:

I am a Computer Science graduate, interested in programming, algorithms, maths
and general problem solving techniques.  I graduted from  a college called
National Engineering College, Tamil Nadu, India. It's a private college, though
an established one in South India. I had tried for GATE and failed 2 times and
I had tried for Subject GRE and have failed 2 times and I am trying it again.

I have an inclination towards research and occupying myself with interesting
fundamental problems, and I also have certain ability to translat the answers
to the fundamental problems to more concrete ones in the products and come out
with new innovations. This is supported by four inventions that have been filed
with USPTO by my former employer Dell.

Well, I personally do not consider them as my achievements because I still feel
that patents from companies are towards securing business value than a real
fundamental breakthrough, but they were important contributions becuase only
few people (4 to be exact in the group of 600) had filed more than 1 patent
over the 5 years I was at Dell.

I had been doing software testing and more occupied with Engineering processes
than software architecture, that I had to move myself to Software Developer's
role on my own initiation. So, I studied the basic books again, solved all the
problems in Kernighan and Ritchie (sometimes honestly and some times not-so
honestly) and started trying for moving to a Developers role. I got some
breakthrough in a developer in test inside Automation team and then I joined
the Python Core Developers through Google's Summer of Code Program. I started
working on enhancing the urllib module and now I am currently the maintainer of
the urllib module. I fix bugs on the module and entertain the feature requests
that come in. I also participate in the discussions in the evolution of Python
language and library. I plan to carry with this task (possibly increasing my
contributions) through out my post-graduation studies as well.

== Endian-ness ==

* Integer is 32 bits.
* 8 bits make a byte.
* So, integers are 4 bytes.
* Least significant byte is the one with lower order of power. Like 2^0^ to 2^7^
* Most significant byte is the one with highest order of power. Like the one with 2^n^ 
* When we are giving address to the bytes, if we start numbering from the Least Significant Byte, we say it is Little Endian.
* If we start address numbering from the Most Significant Byte, we say it is Big Endian format.
* 0x12345678 be the integer. The LSB is 0x78, If that is starting address, 0. then it is Little endian.
* If the addressing starts at 0x12, then it is in Big Endian Format.

Data Structures and Algorithms
==============================

Instructions:
-------------

    1) Solve either the three problems in Section A or the
       single problem in Section B. You must implement your
       algorithms as working programs in the C language.

    2) Try to keep your programs as simple as possible.
       Take care of proper program layout and embellish it
       with useful comments at the appropriate places.

    3) Make your programs as robust as possible. All borderline
       cases should be handled properly and the program should
       exit gracefully under all circumstances.



Section A

Problem A1: Prime Number Generation
-----------------------------------

Given a positive number N, generate all the prime numbers
from 2 to N. The primary emphasis in the solution to this
problem should be on speed. In addition, you must not consume
an inordinate amount of memory.


Problem A2: Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic
------------------------------------------

Implement an arbitrary precision arithmetic calculator.
You should implement addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division in the respective order. Try to make your
program as fast as possible and keep memory usage to the
bare minimum.


Problem A3: Sub-string Search
-----------------------------

Given two strings S1 and S2, determine whether S2 occurs
as a substring in S1 and if so, find the first occurrence
of S2 in S1. Your program should be extremely fast. Try
to come up with a linear solution to the problem.



Section B

Problem B1: Simple File-system Implementation
---------------------------------------------

Implement a simple filesystem within a normal file on the
hard disk, i.e. treat the file as a virtual disk and
implement the filesystem by manipulating records within the
file.

You are free to devise your own scheme for the file system
but it should minimally support the following operations:

   1) Create - Create a virtual hard disk on a file of the
      specified size and "format" it. Formatting would
      essentially involve initialising disk allocation
      structures and whatever else you need to do before
      you can have a valid filesystem.

   2) Open, Read, Write, Close - All the normal file operations
      to use the files.

   3) Delete, Rename - Remove unwanted files or rename existing
      files.

Do not place artificial restrictions on file names, sizes, etc.

In addition, if you can, provide support for folders (also known
as directories) which can be arbitrarily nested. Provide all
the common operations for folders.

You should implement this as a library of routines that can be
used by anyone wanting to treat a file as a filesystem.
Demonstrate the correctness of your routines by writing a demo
program that lets one manipulate files interactively.
