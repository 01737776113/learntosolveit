======================
C Programming Language
======================

* Assignment operator groups right to left.

* A contrast between for and while loop is, the test expression is optional in
  the for loop, it is required in the while loop.

* for(i=0;i<10;i++) is equivalent to for(i=0;i<=9;i++) but the former is
  clearer than the later style.

* If a difficult to write function's interface is well defined, you might write
  a quick-and-dirty function first, test it will the larger part of the program
  and then rewrite the function to include the difficult details.

* printf's name comes from the expression 'print formatted'.

* printf calls putchar to print each character it formats.

* Among other things, how to read a character right away is not defined by the
  C programming language and it is not defined by any of the standard library
  functions. It depends upon the operating system that you are using.  The C
  Standard Library has a couple of functions for reading lines; but they have
  few awkward features.

* What design pattern do you know in C ? for loop, which is initialize, test
  and increment pattern.

* printf wants string as its first argument.
* putchar uses char as its first argument.

* The syntax of preprocessor is different from syntax of C in several aspects.

* There are two additional qualifiers const and volatile, which promise not to
  change or which might change in an unexpected way.
