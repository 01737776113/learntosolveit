University of Toronto

I would like to pursue research in Computer Science at the University of
Toronto, specializing in algorithms and study of related fields such as the
theory of computation, programming language design and distributed systems.  I
have a keen interest in developing algorithms for modeling and solving real
world problems.

As a PhD student, I would like to embark on a career devoted to the development
of computer science which will involve teaching and research on the development
of better software. My Industry experience and my interests render me perfect
for such a role.

My undergraduate studies were completed at the National Engineering College,
India, in the year 2002. Here, I majored in Computer Science and Engineering
and secured an aggregate of 78% in the University examinations, and was ranked
8th in my class of 60. 

My certificate course in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography at the Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore, 2008 provided me with the opportunity to work
on interesting, theoretical problems in Cryptography, and in the study of
mathematics involved in the various cryptographic algorithms. Not only did I
secure excellent grades in the course, but I also developed two player games
using the A* algorithm. 

I also undertook the courses offered by Ars Digita Univ, especially the
algorithms courses offered by Prof. Shai Simonson.  I am inspired by his way of
teaching computer science, which essentially focusses on gaining an insight and
the right intuition for the problem to come up with effective solutions.

As a software engineer in the Computer Industry for 7 years, I have worked on
wide range of projects, in a variety of roles ranging from technical support to
an architect. I have also worked as an independent consultant for companies
assisting in the development of Internal Software Infrastructure.

Over the years, I have developed various automation, simulation, configuration
management, and testing tools utilizing a variety of technologies. I have
mentored and led developers in modern design patterns, implementation,
debugging, documentation, and testing practices. 

Very early in my career, I have veered towards research work and occupied
myself with interesting fundamental problems,  the solutions for which, I have
been able to successfully translate into innovative product implementations.
This is supported by four invention disclosures that have been filed with USPTO
during my employment with Dell India Research and Development Center. I was
awarded "Co-Inventor of the Year 2007" for making significant contributions to
Dell's Patent portfolio.

At Akamai, I have seen good implementations of a standard Computer Science
algorithms and theories in practise. As Akamai was founded by theoretical
computer science experts, I find algorithms like Open Shortest Path First,
cache oblivious algorithms playing an important function in the service
offerings.

The rich repertoire of skills and experience that I have gained as a result of
these experiences would be immensely helpful to me as  a teaching assistant and
research scholar.

I got involved with Python language development through Google Summer of Code
program in 2007. I worked on enhancing the standard library modules. With my
regular contributions, I have become the maintainer for urllib module in Python
language 3. Apart from the technical skills, Python project has taught me the
social skills which are required to work with a diverse group of developers.  I
have been inspired by developers of Python like Guido van Rossum, Martin Von
Lowis and other contributers. I plan to contribute further to the Python
language, in the areas related to Internet modules and interpreter.

I have special interest technologies that are helpful to people with
disabilities. I have helped my friends who are disabled, to use dasher and
voice recognition systems to interact with computers.  I was honored with best
teacher award by Spastics Society of Karnataka, for my volunteer work and
teaching Robotics to the students, in the year 2008.

I known good programmers from University of Toronto through Topcoder
competitions and have also known Prof. Greg Wilson, through his books like
"Beautiful Code" and his writings and snippets in Python. This influenced me
positively to apply to University of Toronto.

I would be dependent on financial aid for my graduate studies, and PhD program
with its research assistance stipend will help to meet financial demands.
