Google Appengine supports any framework written in pure python that speaks CGI (and any WSGI-compliant framework using CGI Adapter).

What does speaking CGI mean?
Or what does WSGI compliant framework using CGI adapter mean?

webapp framework has
- requesthandler
- WSGIApplication that routes the requests to handlers based on the incoming URL.
- the main routine which runs the WSGIApplication using a CGI Adaptor.

The run_wsgi_app() is similar to the WSGI-to-CGI adaptor provided by the
wsgiref module in the Python Standard Library.

You might have to study HTML. Especially the form handling part.

If for some reason you need a single handler to handle both GET and POST actions to the same URL, you can define a method for each action in the same class.
