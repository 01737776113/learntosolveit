Explaination
============

In this program we are going to convert a given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius temperature using the formula C=(5/9)(F-32) To do this we declare some variables in the beginning of the program so that they can be used in the later stages of the program. The variables in this program are: lower,upper,step, . The variable lower is assigned the value 0 similarly upper to 300, step to 20. So when the program enters the for loop it checks whether fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP is true, if it is true then it prints out put.
