This was the first Discipline Score application that I was using.

* Used Bret Taylors Task list code.
* Lot of functionality is in JavaScript. Javascript I believe was mostly generated as it had function names like F, G.
* Remember struggling with the function names.
* The code can serve strictly for educational purposes, due to heavy javascript integration, it cannot be enhanced.
