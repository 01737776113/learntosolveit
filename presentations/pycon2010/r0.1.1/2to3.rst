How to Convert Python 2 to Python 3
===================================

2to3 tool
---------

Run ``./2to3`` to convert stdin (``-``), files or directories given as

2to3 must be run with at least Python 2.6. The intended path for migrating to
Python 3.x is to first migrate to 2.6 (in order to take advantage of Python
2.6's runtime compatibility checks).

* In the tutorial source files, run 2to3 example_for_2to3.py and analyze the
  output.
