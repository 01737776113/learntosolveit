1.1 Write formal descriptions of the following sets.
====================================================

a. The set containing the numbers 1, 10 and 100.
A = {1,10,100}

b. The set containing all integers that are greater than 5.
SET = { n | n ∈ Z and n > 5 }

c. The set containing all natural numbers that are less than 5.
SET = { n | n ∈ N and n < 5 }

d. The set containing the string aba.

SET = {aba}

e. The set containing an empty string.

SET = { ∊ }

f. The set containing nothing at all

SET = ∅

1.2 Let A be the set {x, y, z} and B be the set {x, y}
======================================================

a. Is A a subset of B? FALSE.
b. Is B a subset of A? TRUE.
c. What is A ∪ B?  Answer: A
d. What is A ∩ B?  Answer: B
e. What is A x B?  Answer: {(x,x), (x,y), (y,x), (y, y), (z, x), (z, y)}
f. What is the power set of B?
Answer: { ∅, {x},{y},{x,y}}

1.3 If A has a elements and B has b elements, how many elements are in AxB? 
===========================================================================

AxB has a*b elements. AxB stands for cartesian product which is formed as set
of tuples taking each element from each set.

So for 2 x 2 set.
{a,b} x {c, d} = { (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d)} Thus there are 4 elements.


1.4 Examine the following formal descriptions of sets so that you understand
which members they contain . Write a short informal English description for
each set.
============================================================================

a. { 1, 3, 5, 7 ...}

It is the set of all odd natural numbers.

b. { ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4 ...}
It is the set of all even real numbers.

c. {n | n = 2m for m in N}
It is set of even natural numbers.

d. { n | n = 2m for m in N, and n = 3k for some k in N}

It is set of natural numbers which are divisible by both 2 and 3.

e. { w | w is a string of 0s and 1s and w is equals the reverse of w}

It is set of binary numbers which are bi-directional (that is read the same from left to right and also from right to left).

f. { n | n is an integer and n = n + 1}

It is set of all integers.


1.5 If C is set with c elements, how many elements are in the power set of C? Explain your answer.
==================================================================================================

{x, y}  = { ∅, {x}, {y}, {x,y}}
{x, y, z} =  { ∅, {x} , {y}, {z}, {x, y} , {y, z}, {x, z}, {x, y, z} }
{a, b, c, d} = { ∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {c,a,d}, {d,a,b}, {a,b,c,d}}

Answer: cC0 + cC1 + cC2 + cC3 + ... + cCc


Take c = 4
Answer = 4C0 + 4C1 + 4C2 + 4C3 + 4C4 = 16


1.6 Let X be the set{1,2,3,4,5} and Y be the set {6,7,8,9,10}. The unary
function f: X -> Y  and the binary function g: X x Y -> Y are described in the
following tables.

range: {6,7,8,9,10}

e. What is the value of g(4,f(4))?
Ans: 8

1.7 For each part, give a relation that satisfies the condition.
================================================================

a. Reflexive and Symmetric but not transitive.

Ans:  (a+b) ^ 2

b. Reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.

Ans:  / operator?

c. Symmetric and Transitive but not relexive.

Ans: multiplication by -1.

1.8. Graph

Ans: Drawing in the Notebook

Degree of 1 is 3.
Degree of 3 is 2.
Path from 3 to 4 is 3-2-4.

1.9  Formal Description of the Graph
====================================
Ans: {[1,2,3,4,5,6},{(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)}}


PROBLEMS
========

1.10 The error is dividing by (a-b) which is 0 because we assume a = b. Dividing by zero is not-defined and hence the proof is not valid.

1.11 The Induction Step is wrong. After assuming that H=K+1 are of same color instead of proving mathematically that K+n can be true, it goes about sub-classing the same set and without proceeding to prove a generality.

1.12 Every graph with 2 or more nodes contains 2 nodes that have equal degrees. 

Each edge contributes equally to 2 adjoing nodes or when there is not a edge,
the two seperate nodes have an equal lose.  Taking both the situations into
account, for a given graph with 2 or more nodes, there are 2 nodes that have
same degree.

1.13

Clique of a graph is subgraph in which every 2 nodes are connected by an edge.
Anti-Clique is the subgraph in which every 2 nodes are not connected by an
edge. This is also called as independent set.  Show that every graph with
n-nodes contains either a clique or an anti-clique with at-least 1/2log2 n
nodes.

Answer: This is Ramsey's therom. Generalized for k=2. For which the minimum number of
nodes required is 2.


1.14
Theorem 1.25

P(t) = P*M^t - Y ( M^t - 1) / (M - 1)

P is the principal sum
I is the interest rate
Y is the monthly payment.
M is convenience term for writing M = 1 + I/12

This problem can be solved by using a calculator.

Curious
========
There are 2^903 ways to arrange red, green strings among 43 pegs so each pair
is either connected by red string or by a green string.
