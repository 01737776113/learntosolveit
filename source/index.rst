   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.





`Learn To Solve It`_ is a platform to learn programming in a straight forward
way.

My approach is to choose a good programming book, code examples, solve the
exercises presented by the author and explain the solution. In addition, I have
included a number of programs which demonstrate features of language and
standard library which provide a good language and the style.

The programs can be run directly on `ideone`_ sandbox and I welcome
collaboration via `Github`_ pull requests, which is possibly directly from these
pages.

**Reference Books**

* C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie.
* Python Cookbook by Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft and David Ascher.
* Java Precisely by Peter Sestoft.
