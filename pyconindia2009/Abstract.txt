This talk will feature a number of useful and basic Computer Science Algorithms
written in Python. The following topics will be covered as part of the talk. *
Understanding Algorithm Analysis. * Prime number generation and Primality
Testing. * Sorting Algorithms: * Bubble * Shell * Insert * Merge * Quick *
Graph Data Structure. How to Represent graphs in Python. Graph traversal in
python. * Search algorithms. This talk is aimed towards undergraduate/graduate
students and programmers. Algorithms written in Python would also reveal
Python's expressiveness and show how the language does not come in your way of
thinking and writing the actual code. Python 3.1 would be used for all example
snippets. Examples in Python 2.6 would be available as a reference.

In order to analyze how much time and space, a given algorithm requires,
computer scientists express the time and space required to solve the problem as
a function of the input.
