Categories of Python Programs
-----------------------------

Try to classify each of the program into any of these categories.
And rename the python program as category_name_program_name_#number.py

* text_manipulation
    - This category demonstrates text manipulation. It reads input and applies
      simple text manipulation and provides the output. Many programs fall into this category.
* networking
    - This program demonstrates networking and socket calls. Anything to do with servers and clients.
* web
    - These deal with websites, webapplications and work on top of networking layer.
* design
    - These programs demonstrate software design ascepts. These can be pretty
      deep as, "why" it is done so is not obvious, but the program usually
      demonstrates how it is done.
* algorithm
    - This is an implementation of a well known CS algorithm.
* software_engineering
    - This is how software is built in real world. If your software needs to
      make money, you will need to take care of these aspects.


For e.g, I renamed these programs:

    renamed:    context_1.py -> design_context_manager_1.py
    renamed:    client.py -> networking_socket_client.py
