Problem Statement
=================
    
The prime factorization of a number X is the list of prime numbers that
multiply together to form X. 
For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3. 
Note that 1 is not a prime number.

An underprime is a number whose prime factorization contains a prime number of
elements. For example, 12 is an underprime because its prime factorization
contains 3 elements, and 3 is a prime number. Given ints A and B, return the
number of underprimes between A and B, inclusive.

Definition
----------
    
Class: Underprimes
Method: howMany
Parameters: int, int
Returns: int
Method signature: int howMany(int A, int B)

(be sure your method is public)
    
Notes
-----

- A positive integer number is called prime if it has exactly two divisors - 1
  and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime numbers, and 4, 6, 8 and 9 are
  not prime. By convention, 1 is not considered to be a prime number.

- All prime factorizations of the same integer always contain the same prime
numbers and can only differ by the order of primes within them.

Constraints
-----------

- A will be between 2 and 100000, inclusive.
- B will be between A and 100000, inclusive.

Examples
--------

Example 0)

2
10

Returns: 5

The underprimes in this interval are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.

Example 1)

100
105

Returns: 2

The underprimes in this interval are 102 = 2 * 3 * 17 and 105 = 3 * 5 * 7.

Example 2)

17
17
Returns: 0

17 is a prime number, so its prime factorization contains one element. 1 is not
a prime, so 17 is not an underprime.

Example 3)

123
456
Returns: 217
