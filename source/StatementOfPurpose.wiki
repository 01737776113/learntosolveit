Statement of Purpose
Prepare a concise one or two page essay that describes your primary areas of interest for research, your related experiences, and your objective in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon. Your essay should be specific in describing your interests and motivations. When describing your research interests, you should explain why you think they are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursue them. You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government, or teaching experience.

As an engineer, I was trained to solve problems. As a software developer, I designed tools to help others solve their problems.
