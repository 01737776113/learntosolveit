How to Solve it using Python?
=============================

Senthil Kumaran (orsenthil@gmail.com, +919880459565)

Intended audience
-----------------

Beginning to intermediate Python Programmers. Familiarity
with Python's syntax and usage is assumed.

This tutorial will use Python 3.1 examples (with prominent changes from Python
2.6 explained, whereever it is applicable).

The Source Code and the Handout will contain the snippets written in both
Python 2.6 and Python 3.1.


Tutorial format
---------------

Interactive lecture, I will be explain the common programming problem and how
we can solve using Python. Will share to give some background about the problem
and before introducing the solution.
Whenever there is a Python Standard Library module used to solve a particular
problem, the capablities of that module will be elucidated.

The aim would be the provide the provide an insight into "How to solve it using
Python Standard Library and best practises", so that they would follow the
similar methodologies in future.

I will be taking questions throughout the tutorial.

Recording
---------

I give permission to record and publish my tutorial for free
distribution.

Requirements
------------

Attendees are welcome to bring their laptops with Python installed (
*version 3.1* and *version 2.6* both installed).

Some snippets will be using Twisted Matrix Framework, those who would like to
try those recipes, would like to have Twisted Package installed for their
Python Distribution.

Notes for Reviewers
-------------------

At PyCon 2009, I presented "A Tour of Python Standard Library", I realized that
having a Problem-Solution styled tutorial will be very effective to present the
capablities of Python Standard Library and will be efficient to keep the
audience engaged.

The problems I have selected are based on the my own experience some of the
frequently encounted ones, having a discussion on those problems in a class
room like atmosphere will tend to make the attendees recollect the discussion
whenever they encounter the situation again.

Python 3.x is becoming popular, I choose to present the recipes in Python 3.x
for the reason that, the audience can see that there is not much difference in
the syntax for recipes and how at times, the Python 3.x facilities are helpful
to solve the problem better.

I have presented an Introduction to Python Standard Library at Freed.in, open
source conference in India and found that student community were particularly
interested in this topic. After the audience had attended a introductory python
programming lecture, introducing them to various standard library modules using
example snippets, gives them a lot of confidence to develop projects using
Python. With a little initiation, it was found that, audience were able to
explore other modules with ease.

Certain programming aspects like how to extend the standard library for
projects can be demonstrated. Also in all the modules covered, I have decided
to devote a separate section on changes that module has undergone in Python
3K. I assuming that programmers would like to know one style completely and
will be able to realize that porting the same programs Py3k should not be hard.
Certain modules towards the end can be presented in Py3K itself.

I have chosen the standard library modules, which I am most comfortable with
while working on bugs related to them and modules which feature frequent discussions in
tutor-list and modules which will most frequently used by developers.

Promotional Summary
-------------------

Welcome to ``A Tour of Python Standard Library``. Together let us explore the
various modules, which will help you to build robust working programs.

Once you know about a particular library well, you will start replacing those 20
odd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines and feel safe that your code
will now work on all the platforms that Python supports.

Just like the galaxy, the Python Standard Library is vast and when hitch-hiking
I will take you through some important ones that happen to be used most
often. You can explore, ask questions, experiment through out the ride.

Welcome! And let the journey begin.


Outline for Review
------------------

* A very brief Introduction to Python and Python Standard Library (20 minutes)
	- Introduction to Python. 
		- Recollecting topics from earlier tutorials.
	- Brief tour of Standard Library. 
		- Giving the audience an overall picture.
		- Explaining the "Batteries Included" philosophy.
	- Operating System Interface.
	- Command Line Arguments.
	- String Pattern Matching.
	- Internet Access
	- Multi-threading.
	- Logging.
	- Structure of the Python Standard Library in Python 2.6 and Changes to
	  Standard Library in Python 3.0.
	- How to get help about a particular library module.

* Built-In Modules and Exceptions. (30 minutes)
	- Example Program 1 which explains the built-in functions
		- abs
		- dir
		- enumerate
		- file
		- hasattr
		- setattr
		- getattr
	- Example Program 2 which explains the built-in types
		- and, or, not
		- int, float, long, complex
		- dict
		- iterator types.
		- File Objects.
	- Built-In Exceptions.
		- Example Program 3 explaining demonstrating Exceptions

* Operating Systems, Files and Directory Access. (30 minutes)
	- Overview of various modules present in this category. ( Tabular form)
	- Peek into certain modules in detail. My idea is to divide the 30 minute session into two snippets(15 minutes each), while effectively demonstrating certain modules usage and important methods in that module.  Other sections will follow the similar pattern.
		- os
		- time
		- shutil
		- glob
