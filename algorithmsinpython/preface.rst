Introductory Comments
=====================

Studying algorithms using a high level language such such a Python is fun.  It
makes understanding the algorithms easy, playing with the algorithm
implementation possible. It also makes it possible to roughly model an
algorithm and measure it's performance.

The intention of this book would be to simplify things for understanding the
nature of the algorithms involved in the products.  I would not mind removing
the term 'algorithm' to something else, in order to convey the message that
this really is not a heavy subject or a subject which people with hubris will
talk about. It is about games and it is about fun.

Let's see how far we go. Both in Python and in err.. having fun.

The idea is to develop a handy set of algorithms in Languages such a Python and
C++ which can be useful in coding contests.

To understand the algorithm, pick up the easiest sample set and run through the
code in your mind.
