::

    Project name change. Former uthcode.com project is now called
    learntosolveit.com. Please update your bookmarks.

`Learn To Solve It` is a platform to learn programming in straight forward way.
Choose a problem, solve it using a programming language, learn the syntax,
explain the approach, gather feedback and improve.

We have attempted to solve commonly occurring problems, frequently encountered
tasks which form building blocks of large projects in multiple languages.

The solution can easily be verified by running on ideone sandbox and
collabration is most welcome by sending a pull request via Github.
