How to Start Learning Python ?
==============================


This page is an introduction to how to get started with python.

Unix/Linux
==========


On Unix/Linux, the Python interpreter is inbuilt. So, if you type _python_
at the command prompt you might get a response something like this.

::

        $python
        Python 2.6.2+ (release26-maint:72495, May 10 2009, 09:18:23) 
        [GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> 

This means that Python is installed and _>>>_  symbol is the Python interpreter
symbol.Normally, you will write python programs using a text editor and then
execute the program using the interpreter.

::

        $cat hello.py
        print 'Hello,World'
        $python hello.py
        Hello,World
        $

If you would like to install a higher version of Python interpreter than it is
currently installed on your system, you may download python from
http://www.python.org website.

Rest of the steps should be same.

Windows
=======

Microsoft Windows does not ship python by default.  However, there is a binary
available from http://python.org website. It comes with an editor called IDLE
(which can be used to start with). But all developers use other editors like
vim, emacs, notepad++ and other editors in Windows too.

On Windows, there is also special package available, which has integration with
[http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html Windows APIS]
and has an editor called _Pythonwin_, coming bundled which is pretty good for
beginners. The above mentioned way is the best way to get started on Windows.

If you would like to take a shortcut route, then Active State is the Company
which has bundled them all together and provides the Python Win editor too.

[http://www.activestate.com/downloads/#tab_python_stack Download Activestate Python here]

I am mentioning Active State Python after the Python from http://www.python.org
because newcomers if they download Python from Activestate to start kind of
think that Python interpretor is available from Activestate Company only and
forget that they can download Python directly from the Source. 

Well, Activestate is a _good_ company working with Open Source technologies and
they have contribute a lot back to Python trunk too.

So, it is just your convenience as how you want to Download Python on Windows.

There are plenty of good tutorials on python available on the Internet.

For Programmers
===============

A Good Beginners Mini Project
=============================

After you have completed reading those tutorial, I would suggest you try this
mini-project.

* [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/cs9honline/#Program1DLife One Dimentional Life]
* [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/cs9honline/P1/ One Dimentional Life]

It is not difficult one. It is interesting project and output will be an image file.
So, its kind of souvenir for you for completing your first Python mini project.
