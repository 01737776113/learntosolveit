Factory Method Pattern 
----------------------

* Object Oriented Design Pattern.
* It is a creational pattern, dealing with creation of objects (products)
  without specifying the exact class.
* The creational patterns abstract the concept of instantiating objects.
* It handles this case by defining a separate method for creation objects.
* The subclasses of that method or object (??)can override to specify the
  derived type of the product that will be created.
* Factory method is used to refer to any method whose main purpose is to create
  objects. 
* The Factory pattern in c++ wraps the usual object creation syntax new
  someclass() in a function or a method which can control the creation.
* Advantages is that, code using the class no longer needs to know all the
  details of creation. It may not even know the exact type of object
  created.
* Abstract Factory provides additional indirection to let the type of object
  which is created to vary.
* Factory pattern is fundamental in python; while languages like C++ use
  ClassName class; to create classes python uses function class syntax to
  create objects. Even builtin types str, int provide factory pattern.
