Multipart Form Data

RFC 2388 - For Form uploads.
RFC 2045 - For multipart MIME data streams.

The content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is inefficient for
sending large quantities of binary data or text containing non-ASCII
characters. The content type "multipart/form-data" should be used for
submitting forms that contain files, non-ASCII data and binary data.

"multipart/form-data" message contains a series of parts, each
representing a successful control.

What is a successful control?

Questions
---------

1. Does the transfer of different parts happen sequentially or at one go?
2. I think, it makes sense to transfer in sequence instead of all at once.
3. What's ENCTYPE?
4. What's the difference between "multipart/form-data" and "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"?
