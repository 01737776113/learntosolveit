to the right by n positions.

Explanation
===========

We need to get the right most bit of the number provided.

The right most bit can be got by left shifting all the digits except the right
most. This is done by first capturing wordlength() and then left shifting the x
& 1 with wordlength() -1

::

        rbit = (x & 1) << (wordlength()-1);

 The resultant value will be something like 1000 0000 for any right most bit of 1.
 


Once we get the right most bit, in order to rotate the value of x, we right
shift x and then OR the result of x with the rbit determined in the previous
step.

::

        x = x >> 1;
        x = x | rbit;

For example.

Let's take **x** as 0001 1001 and when it is right rotated we will get the
result as 10001 100 (rearranging that: 1000 1100)


First we calculate the rbit::

		(x & 1) = 0001 1001 & 1111 1111
		        = 0001 1001

		(x & 1) << (wordlength() -1) = 0001 1001 << (8 - 1)
							         = 0001 1001 << 7
							         = 1 000 0000
							         = 1000 0000

So we have got the right most bit set. Now we right x by 1 and OR the rbit with x.

::

		x >> 1 =  0001 1001 >> 1
			   =  0 0001 100
			   =  0000 1100

		x | rbit = 0000 1100 | 1000 0000
			     = 1000 1100


Which is our expected result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The another way is get the right n bits at one time.
 ::
 	rbit = x << (wordlength() - n);
 
 Once we get the right n bits, in order to rotate the value of x, we right
shift x for n bits and then OR the result of x with the rbit determined in the previous
step.

::

        x = x >> n;
        x = x | rbit;
        
 For the same example.
  n is between 0 - wordlength()
condition 1.	when  (n == 0) or (n == wordlength()) 	rightrot(x, 0) == x
condition 2.	when  (n > 0) and (n < wordlength())	like n = 3
 		x  = 0001 1001
 		the right n bits will be 001.
 		the right rightrot(x,n)result should be 0010 0011
 		
		x << (wordlength() - n) = 0001 1001 << (8 - 3)
					   = 0001 1001 << 5
					   = 0010 0000
So we have got the right most n bits set.Now we right x by 1 and OR the rbit with x.

::

		x >> n =  0001 1001 >> 3
			= 0000 0011

		x | rbit = 0000 0011 | 0010 0000
			     = 0010 0011
Which is our expected result.

condition 3	when (n > wordlength())	like n = 12
The Compiler will auto transfer "n" to "n % wordlength()", n will be 3, then see "n" as condition 2.
The result should be correct too!

condition 4	when n < 0	(which is not Often use)
The result will mirror the function,the rightrot(x,n) function will move the left most n(n > 0)bits to the right
side ï¼Œthe function should called leftrot(x,n).
