Name of the Presenter: O.R.Senthil Kumaran

Description of the Talk:

This talk will explore the core networking libraries available in Python.

This will be 30 minute talk with the overview of the capabilities of 4 major networking library.

1. Python Standard Library. http and urllib package (Python3 and Python2)
2. Capabilities of other 3rd party networking libraries - pycurl and httplib2. When to use them and why they exist.
3. Asychronous Network IO using Twisted Matrix Framework.
4. Tornado framework capablities - Generic overview.

In this talk, I intend to go in-depth with design and capablities of Python
Standard Library and explain the other packages/ libraries as an Overview.

Revelant points would be mentioned about usage scenarios of each networking
library, their strong points and weakness so that audience at the end can gain
a knowledge about each of them and should be able to make as informed decision
about choosing the networking library for the application.

Detailed explaination would be given on Asychrnouos libraries which would need
the audience to understand Reactor pattern.
