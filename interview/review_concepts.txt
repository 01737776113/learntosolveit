Rabin Karp Algorithm

Heaps

A heap is really good at basic ordering and keeping track of max and mins
This is actually interesting – if you had two heaps, you could keep track of
the biggest half and the smallest half of the elements   The biggest half is
kept in a min heap, such that the smallest element in the biggest half is at
the root   The smallest half is kept in a max heap, such that the biggest
element of the smallest half is at the root   Now, with these data structures,
you have the potential median elements at the roots   If the heaps are no
longer the same size, you can quickly “rebalance” the heaps by popping an
element off the one heap and pushing it onto the other
